## Hi there 👋 I'm Kai

🚀 **Backend Engineer | Self-Taught ML Explorer | Code-First Thinker**

Welcome to the digital hub of my experiments, side projects, and unapologetic deep dives into the world of code, computation, and machine intelligence.

### 🧠 About Me

- 🧩 I engineer backend systems that are battle-tested, cleanly designed, and future-ready.
- 🤖 I'm teaching myself machine learning & AI from the ground up—because why not reverse-engineer intelligence?
- 🧬 Currently neck-deep in computer vision, neural networks, and all things Pythonic.
- ⚡ I believe in learning by building, breaking things, and shipping code into the wild.
- 📂 My GitHub is more than a repo list—it's a living record of my evolution as a developer.

### 🔍 Current Focus

- 🧠 **Computer Vision** & real-time image processing with `OpenCV`
- 🔥 **Deep Learning** workflows in `PyTorch` & `TensorFlow`
- 🧪 Experimenting with custom CNNs, image classifiers, and model evaluation
- 🎓 Immersed in bootcamps from [OpenCV University](https://opencv.org/opencv-university/)
